    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For these blackberry cheesecake brownies, a fruity, blackberry-swirled cheesecake layer sits atop a chewy chocolate brownie layer in this gorgeously tasty dessert. Plan ahead, as these need time to chill in the refrigerator.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Blackberry Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cup frozen blackberries</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For blackberry sauce, combine frozen blackberries, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a small saucepan set over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring often, until berries fall apart, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove mixture from heat, and pour into a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl. Use the back of a wooden spoon or spatula to press berry mixture through the sieve, extracting as much juice as possible. Discard seeds. Pour sauce back into saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat.</li>
        <li>Stir cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until thoroughly combined; stir cornstarch slurry into blackberry sauce and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow blackberry sauce to cool completely, about 20 minutes. The sauce can be refrigerated to speed up cooling.</li>
    </ol>
